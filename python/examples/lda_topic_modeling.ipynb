    "# HPXPy Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation using HPXPy, demonstrating:\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic topic modeling** - discover hidden topics in document collections\n",
    "2. **Gibbs sampling** - MCMC method for Bayesian inference\n",
    "3. **Distributed document parallelism** - scale to millions of documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a probabilistic model that assumes:\n",
    "- Each document is a **mixture of topics**\n",
    "- Each topic is a **distribution over words**\n",
    "- Words in documents are generated by:\n",
    "  1. Pick a topic from document's topic distribution\n",
    "  2. Pick a word from that topic's word distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **w[d,n]**: nth word in document d\n",
    "- **z[d,n]**: topic assignment for w[d,n]\n",
    "- **θ[d,t]**: probability of topic t in document d\n",
    "- **φ[t,w]**: probability of word w in topic t\n",
    "- **α**: Dirichlet prior for document-topic distributions (controls topic mixing)\n",
    "- **β**: Dirichlet prior for topic-word distributions (controls word diversity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gibbs Sampling Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "For each word position (d, n):\n",
    "1. Remove current topic assignment z[d,n]\n",
    "2. Sample new topic from posterior:\n",
    "   - P(z[d,n]=t | ...) ∝ (word-topic count + β) × (doc-topic count + α) / (topic total + β×V)\n",
    "3. Update counts with new assignment\n",

    "- All-reduce word-topic matrix: (num_words × num_topics) floats\n",
    "- Document-topic matrix stays local (no communication!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key optimization:** Sparse word-topic matrix\n",
    "- Most word-topic pairs have zero count\n",
    "- Only communicate non-zero entries\n",
    "- Typical sparsity: 90-99% zeros\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Asynchronous LDA:**\n",
    "   - Nodes don't wait for all-reduce\n",
    "   - Use slightly stale word-topic counts\n",
    "   - 2-5× faster convergence\n",
    "   - Slight quality degradation (acceptable)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sparse Communication:**\n",
    "   - Only send non-zero word-topic entries\n",
    "   - 10-100× less communication\n",
    "   - Critical for large vocabularies\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Multi-level topic hierarchy\n",
    "   - Coarse topics at top level (global)\n",
    "   - Fine topics within each coarse topic (local)\n",
    "   - Reduces global synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mini-batch Gibbs Sampling:**\n",
    "   - Process small document batches\n",
    "   - Update counts after each batch\n",
    "   - More frequent but cheaper synchronization\n",
    "   - Better for streaming data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LDA Scales Well\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document independence:** Sampling for different docs is independent\n",
    "2. **Local document-topic counts:** No need to synchronize across nodes\n",
    "3. **Sparse word-topic matrix:** Communication scales with non-zeros, not vocab size\n",
    "4. **Embarrassingly parallel sampling:** Linear speedup within iteration\n",
    "5. **Tolerates staleness:** Async updates work well for MCMC methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes LDA one of the most scalable ML algorithms - proven at billion-document scale!"
